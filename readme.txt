This integration will allow you to offer a tree each time a customer buys a product using WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This integration will allow you to offer a tree each time a customer buys a product using WooCommerce.
1 tree will be offered for each product purchase. For example, if a user makes 1 purchase which includes 2 x Product A and 3 x Product B, this user will receive an email with his 5 trees offered by your brand.

Some options are available:
* Limit to some specific products: specify which products will trigger a tree planted, instead of all products.
* Limit to 1 (or X) tree per order: a purchase of 5 products will only generate 1 tree.

Once you completed this integration, the system will be 100% automated.

Total integration takes less than 10 minutes on your side :)
